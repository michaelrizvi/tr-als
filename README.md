# TR-ALS: A Tensor Ring Decomposition using Alternating Least Squares
`tr-als` is a solver for decomposing arbitrary order tensors into their tensor ring factorization using alternating least squares.


## Description

This solver was written in the context of the honours project (IFT3150) at University of Montr√©al. The goal of the project is to analyze and compare the performance of the ALS algorithm to the greedy algorithm proposed by M. Hashemizadeh et al. in their paper [Adaptive Learning of Tensor Network Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05437) for the specific task of tensor ring decomposition.

### Dependencies

In order to install the required dependencies, navigate to the project repository and run the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program

In order to execute the solver, first start by creating an instance of the class, then call the `solve` method. More details about the parameters for this method are given in the docstrings.
```
als = ALS(T, ranks, n_epochs=100)
als.solve(verbose=True)

```
`T` is the tensor to factorize, `ranks` is a list of integers corresponding to the ranks and `n_epochs` is the number of iterations the solver will run for. For more information on the parameters, see the docstrings in the code.
